# Welcome!
This is a Birthday challenge for BÃ©atrice.  Please follow the steps below:

1.  Download the input.txt file.
2.  Write a program to read in the file and count the number of times the typo "bananagramsqueen" is the only typo in a line.
3.  Put that number at the end of this url:  http://bit.ly/bea
4.  Past complete url into a browser!


## Example
In the following text sample
```
queen of bananagrams queen of bananagrams queenof bananagramsqueen of bananagrams
queen of bananagrams queen of bananagrams queen of bananagrams
queen of bananagrams queen of bananagrams queen of bananagrams queen of bananagrams queen ofbananagrams queen of bananagrams
queen of bananagrams queen of bananagrams queen of bananagramsqueen of bananagrams
```
There are two lines with the typo (the first and last), but only the last line has "bananagramsqueen" as the only typo.
